My portfolio page at m1well.com isn't just a list of skills or a digital
resume - it's my professional statement, a carefully crafted space designed to
tell you who I am as a developer.

## Who Am I

As the page highlights right away, I'm a Fullstack Developer with over ten years
of experience under my belt, primarily focused on building robust, scalable
enterprise applications. My core toolkit revolves around Java/Spring Boot for
the backend and Angular for the frontend, but my skills extend into databases
like MySQL and Postgres, messaging with RabbitMQ, and the essential DevOps
practices using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. More than just
listing technologies, I wanted the page to reflect my core values: pragmatism, a
commitment to clean code and domain-driven design, and a belief in agile
methodologies.

## Why This Page?

I created this portfolio to serve as a central hub - a place where potential
employers, collaborators, or anyone curious can get a comprehensive
understanding of my professional identity. It brings together my experience, a
detailed (and honest!) breakdown of my technical skills, showcases my personal
projects, and even offers a glimpse into my thoughts through the blog section.
Think of it as my digital handshake, offering a deeper introduction than a
simple CV ever could.

### What It Says About Me

I hope the overall impression is that of a seasoned, meticulous, and engaged
developer. The detailed skills section, complete with proficiency levels, is my
attempt at transparency. Highlighting personal projects like `MaverickWave` (the
CSS framework powering this very site!), `Idently`, and `versions` is crucial
because they demonstrate my passion for coding extends beyond the 9-to-5 and my
desire to contribute back to the community - something reinforced by the links
to my GitHub and Dev.to profiles.

_Furthermore, building this portfolio itself was an opportunity to learn and
apply something new: I chose to develop it using Astro, a modern static site
generator that perfectly aligns with my approach to web development. Astro's
component-based architecture, TypeScript support, and performance-first
philosophy made it an ideal choice for creating a fast, maintainable portfolio
that showcases both my technical skills and attention to modern web standards._

The clean layout, the use of my own framework, and even the disclaimers about
privacy and employer separation are all intentional choices aimed at projecting
professionalism and attention to detail.

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, I want visitors to see me not just as someone who writes code, but
as a well-rounded software craftsman focused on delivering value and sharing
knowledge within the developer community.
